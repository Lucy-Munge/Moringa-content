One common use case of JSON files will be when you are connecting to various websites through their established APIs to retrieve data from them. With these, you are typically given a schema for how the data is structured and then will use this knowledge to retrieve pertinent information.\n",

    "* Use the JSON module to load and parse JSON documents\n",

    "## Reading a JSON Schema\n",

    "In this lesson, you'll take a look at the response from the New York Times API. (We cover APIs in more depth in other lessons, but the general idea is that the New York Times makes some of its data available over the web, and it uses the JSON format to do so.)\n",
