    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals. Check them out [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)! We'll start by talking about PEP8, which is the Style Guide for Python code. This discusses many points which are also important for collaboration. Git is useful for sharing and integrating code bases, but if code is poorly written it can still be cryptic and difficult to decipher. By following styling guidelines such as those outlined in PEP8, we can all create more legible code that can be shared in a streamlined fashion.\n",

    "- List the conventions defined in PEP8 \n",
    "\n",
    "## PEP8 Introductory notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the guidelines in PEP8 are just that: guidelines. The main goal is to make code more readable. Often, projects may have their own style guidelines which should take precedence. Most important of all is consistency. Be consistent with how you format your code and stick to it. With that, here's an overview of some of the most important guidelines from the PEP8 document to start familiarizing yourself with."

    "\n",
    "1. Avoid trailing whitespace; its hard to see!\n",
    "2. Always use whitespace on either side of binary operators like `=`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `not`, `in`, `and`, `or` ...\n",
    "3. If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). For example, multiplication takes precedence over addition, so we might not include whitespace around the multiplication, helping to indicate that these operations happen first and form a cohesive group."

This is how any library is written. You may share this file with collaborators or make it open-source (available to the public on a platform like github).
