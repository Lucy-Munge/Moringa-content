    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand, the standard deviation of the population is not known (which is usually the case), you have to use the standard deviation of your sample as a stand-in when creating confidence intervals. Since the sample standard deviation is often different than that of the population, further potential errors are introduced to our confidence intervals. To account for this error, we use what's known as a t-critical value instead of the $z$-critical value.\n",
