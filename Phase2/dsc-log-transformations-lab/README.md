# Log Transformations - Lab

## Introduction

It's time to practice some logarithmic transformations on the Ames Housing dataset!

## Objectives

You will be able to:

- Determine if a log transformation would be useful for a specific model or set of data
- Apply log transformations to independent and dependent variables in linear regression
- Interpret the coefficients of variables that have been transformed using a log transformation

## Ames Housing Data

Below we load the numeric features from the Ames Housing dataset into a dataframe. We also drop any rows with missing data.


```python
# Run this cell without changes
import pandas as pd
ames = pd.read_csv("ames.csv", index_col=0)
ames = ames.select_dtypes("number")
ames.dropna(inplace=True)
ames
```

## Identify Good Candidates for Log Transformation

Below we plot each of the potential numeric features against `SalePrice`:


```python
# Run this cell without changes
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

y = ames["SalePrice"]
X = ames.drop("SalePrice", axis=1)

fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=6, ncols=6, figsize=(15,15), sharey=True)

for i, column in enumerate(X.columns):
    # Locate applicable axes
    row = i // 6
    col = i % 6
    ax = axes[row][col]
    
    # Plot feature vs. y and label axes
    ax.scatter(X[column], y, alpha=0.2)
    ax.set_xlabel(column)
    if col == 0:
        ax.set_ylabel("SalePrice")

fig.tight_layout()
```

Let's say we want to build a model with **at least one log-transformed feature** as well as a **log-transformed target**

Do you see any features that look like good candidates for this type of transformation?

For reference, a good candidate for this might look like any of these three graphs:

Try to find one feature that resembles each of these shapes.

Because this is real-world messy data, none of them are going to match perfectly, and that's ok!


```python
# Your written answer here

```

### Plot Log Transformed Versions of Features

For each feature that you identified as a good candidate for log transformation, plot the feature vs. `SalePrice` as well as the log transformed feature vs. log transformed `SalePrice`.


```python
# Your code here
```

Do the transformed relationships look more linear? If so, they should be included in the model.

## Build a Model with Log-Transformed Features and Target

### Data Preparation

Choose up to 3 of the features you investigated, and set up an X dataframe containing the log-transformed versions of these features as well as a y series containing the log-transformed version of the target.

    <summary style="cursor: pointer"><b>Hint (click to reveal)</b></summary>

If you are planning log transform a feature measured in _years_ (e.g. `YearRemodAdd`) consider shifting the data first. For example, you might subtract 1900 or 1910 from the year, so that a 1% increase in year is closer to meaning 1 year rather than 20 years.

```python
# Your code here - prepare data for modeling

```

### Modeling

Now build a StatsModels OLS model with a log-transformed target as well as log-transformed features.


```python
# Your code here - build a model

```

### Model Evaluation and Interpretation

How did the model perform? How might we interpret its coefficients? Create as many cells as needed.


```python
# Your code here - evaluate the model

```

## Summary

Now you have practiced modeling with log transformations! This is a subtle, messy process, so don't be discouraged if this was a tricky lab.
