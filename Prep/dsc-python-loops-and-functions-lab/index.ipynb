    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Recall what you learned in the previous section\n",
    " - Practice writing loops to pull multiple pieces of data from a dataset\n",
    " - Practice writing functions for organization and avoiding repetition\n",
    " \n",
    "## Your Task: Dynamically Query Amazon Review Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we are going to be working with data collected by Computer Science researchers at the University of California, San Diego. Their full paper citation is here:\n",
