    "# Classes and Instances\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll take a look at class and instance objects in Python and how to create them. A Python class can be thought of as the blueprint for creating a code object (or **instance object**). It has both the layout for new objects as well as the ability to create those objects. When you **initialize** or make a new instance object from a class, you are essentially pressing a button on an assembly line that instantly rolls out a new instance object. For example, if you were dealing with a `Car` class, you would get a brand new car from the assembly line. In cases where you want to create multiple objects, you can see how this functionality would be extremely useful.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe a class and how it can be used to create objects \n",
    "- Describe an instance object \n",
    "- Create an instance of a class \n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a class\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are starting a ride share business. Let's call it *fuber*. All rides generally have the same basic information. They have a driver, passenger(s), origin, destination, car information, and price. You plan on having a pretty large client base, so, you could imagine having many rides being taken every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you will need to have a way to bundle up and operate on all the above information about a particular ride. And as the business would take off, you are going to need to create rides over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you use Python to help make this process easier? Using Python classes. You can create a `Ride` class that can produce ride instance objects, which would bundle all the information and common operations for a particular ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, a class can be thought of as the blueprint that defines how to build an instance object. The `Ride` class is different from an actual ride instance object just as the blueprint for a house is different from the actual house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our `Ride` class would look like in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " class Ride:\n",
    "    # code for distance attribute\n",
    "    # code for time attribute\n",
    "    # code for price attribute\n",
    "    # code to start a ride\n",
    "    # code to end a ride\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that you use the keyword `class` to define a Python class. Similar to functions, all the code in a class should be indented. To end the class, you simply stop indenting.\n",
    "\n",
    " > **Note:** Python's convention is that all classes should follow the UpperCaseCamelCase convention. That is the class should begin with a capital letter and all other words in the name should also be capitalized. This is otherwise referred to as CamelCase.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not enough to simply declare a class in Python. All classes need to have a block of code inside them or else you will get an error. Let's see this below:"
