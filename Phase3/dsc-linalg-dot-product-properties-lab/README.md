# Properties of Dot Product - Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll be practicing some interesting properties of a dot product-type matrix multiplication. Understanding these properties will become useful as you study machine learning. The lab will require you to calculate results to provide a proof for these properties.

## Objectives

In this lab you will: 

- Demonstrate the distributive, commutative, and associative property of dot products 
- Use the transpose method to transpose Numpy matrices 
- Compute the dot product for matrices and vectors 


## Instructions

* For each property, create suitably sized matrices with random data to prove the equations 
* Ensure that size/dimension assumptions are met while performing calculations (you'll see errors otherwise)
* Calculate the LHS and RHS for all equations and show if they are equal or not

## Distributive Property - matrix multiplication IS distributive

### Prove that $A \cdot (B+C) = (A \cdot B + A \cdot C) $


```python
# Your code here
```

## Associative Property - matrix multiplication IS associative
### Prove that $A \cdot (B \cdot C) = (A \cdot B) \cdot C $


```python
# Your code here 
```

## Commutative Property - matrix multiplication is NOT commutative
### Prove that for matrices, $A \cdot B \neq B \cdot A $


```python
# Your code here 
```

## Commutative Property -  vector multiplication IS commutative
### Prove that for vectors,  $x^T \cdot y = y^T \cdot x$
Note: superscipt<sup>T</sup> denotes the transpose we saw earlier


```python
# Your code here 
```

## Simplification of the matrix product
### Prove that $ (A \cdot B)^T = B^T \cdot A^T $


```python
# Your code here 
```

## Summary 

You've seen enough matrix algebra by now to solve a problem of linear equations as you saw earlier. You'll now see how to do this next.
