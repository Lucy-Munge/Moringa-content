# Regression Trees and Model Optimization - Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, we'll see how to apply regression analysis using CART trees while making use of some hyperparameter tuning to improve our model. 

## Objectives

In this lab you will: 

- Perform the full process of cleaning data, tuning hyperparameters, creating visualizations, and evaluating decision tree models 
- Determine the optimal hyperparameters for a decision tree model and evaluate the performance of decision tree models

## Ames Housing dataset 

The dataset is available in the file `'ames.csv'`. 

- Import the dataset and examine its dimensions: 


```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')
%matplotlib inline

# Load the Ames housing dataset 
data = None

# Print the dimensions of data


# Check out the info for the dataframe


# Show the first 5 rows

```

## Identify features and target data 

In this lab, we will use using 3 predictive continuous features:

#### Features

- `LotArea`: Lot size in square feet
- `1stFlrSF`: Size of first floor in square feet
- `GrLivArea`: Above grade (ground) living area square feet

#### Target

- `SalePrice`', the sale price of the home, in dollars

- Create DataFrames for the features and the target variable as shown above 
- Inspect the contents of both the features and the target variable


```python
# Features and target data
target = None
features = None
```

## Inspect correlations 

- Use scatter plots to show the correlation between the chosen features and the target variable
- Comment on each scatter plot 


```python
# Your code here 
```

## Create evaluation metrics

- Import `r2_score` and `mean_squared_error` from `sklearn.metrics` 
- Create a function `performance(true, predicted)` to calculate and return both the R-squared score and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for two equal-sized arrays for the given true and predicted values 
    - Depending on your version of sklearn, in order to get the RMSE score you will need to either set `squared=False` or you will need to take the square root of the output of the `mean_squared_error` function - check out [the documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html) or this helpful and related [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17197492/is-there-a-library-function-for-root-mean-square-error-rmse-in-python)
    - The benefit of calculating RMSE instead of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is that RMSE is in the same units at the target - here, this means that RMSE will be in dollars, calculating how far off in dollars our predictions are away from the actual prices for homes, on average


```python
# Import metrics


# Define the function
def performance(y_true, y_predict):
    """ 
    Calculates and returns the two performance scores between 
    true and predicted values - first R-Squared, then RMSE
    """

    # Calculate the r2 score between 'y_true' and 'y_predict'

    # Calculate the root mean squared error between 'y_true' and 'y_predict'

    # Return the score

    pass


# Test the function
score = performance([3, -0.5, 2, 7, 4.2], [2.5, 0.0, 2.1, 7.8, 5.3])
score

# [0.9228556485355649, 0.6870225614927066]
```

## Split the data into training and test sets

- Split `features` and `target` datasets into training/test data (80/20) 
- For reproducibility, use `random_state=42`


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 

# Split the data into training and test subsets
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = None
```

## Grow a vanilla regression tree

- Import the `DecisionTreeRegressor` class
- Run a baseline model for later comparison using the datasets created above
- Generate predictions for test dataset and calculate the performance measures using the function created above 
- Use `random_state=45` for tree instance
- Record your observations


```python
# Import DecisionTreeRegressor


# Instantiate DecisionTreeRegressor 
# Set random_state=45
regressor = None

# Fit the model to training data


# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = None

# Calculate performance using the performance() function 
score = None
score

# [0.5961521990414137, 55656.48543887347] - R2, RMSE
```

## Hyperparameter tuning (I)

- Find the best tree depth using depth range: 1-30
- Run the regressor repeatedly in a `for` loop for each depth value  
- Use `random_state=45` for reproducibility
- Calculate RMSE and r-squared for each run 
- Plot both performance measures for all runs 
- Comment on the output 


```python
# Your code here 
```

## Hyperparameter tuning (II)

- Repeat the above process for `min_samples_split` 
- Use a range of values from 2-10 for this hyperparameter 
- Use `random_state=45` for reproducibility
- Visualize the output and comment on results as above 


```python
# Your code here 
```

# Run the *optimized* model 

- Use the best values for `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` found in previous runs and run an optimized model with these values 
- Calculate the performance and comment on the output 


```python
# Your code here 
```

## Level up (Optional)

- How about bringing in some more features from the original dataset which may be good predictors?
- Also, try tuning more hyperparameters like `max_features` to find a more optimal version of the model 


```python
# Your code here 
```

## Summary 

In this lab, we looked at applying a decision-tree-based regression analysis on the Ames Housing dataset. We saw how to train various models to find the optimal values for hyperparameters.
