When classifying a binary variable, however, a model is either correct or incorrect. As a result, we tend to quantify this in terms of how many false positives versus false negatives we come across. In particular, we examine a few different specific measurements when evaluating the performance of a classification algorithm. In this lab, you'll review precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score in order to evaluate our logistic regression models.\n", "\n", "\n", "## Objectives \n", "\n", "In this lab you will: \n", "\n", "- Implement evaluation metrics from scratch using Python \n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "## Terminology review  \n", "\n", "Let's take a moment and review some classification evaluation metrics:  \n", "\n", "\n", "$$ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Number of Predicted Positives}} $$    \n", "\n", "$$ \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Number of Actual Total Positives}} $$  \n", "  \n", "$$ \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives + True Negatives}}{\\text{Total Observations}} $$\n", "\n", "$$ \\text{F1 score} = 2 * \\frac{\\text{Precision * Recall}}{\\text{Precision + Recall}} $$\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["At times, it may be best to tune a classification algorithm to optimize against precision or recall rather than overall accuracy.
