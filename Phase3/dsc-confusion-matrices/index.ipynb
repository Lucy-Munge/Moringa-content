    "A confusion matrix tells us four important things. Let's assume a model was trained for a **_Binary Classification_** task, meaning that every item in the dataset has a ground-truth value of 1 or 0. To make it easier to understand, let's pretend this model is trying to predict whether or not someone has a disease. A confusion matrix gives you the following information: \n",
    "\n",
    "**_True Positives (TP)_**: The number of observations where the model predicted the person has the disease (1), and they actually do have the disease (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**_True Negatives (TN)_**: The number of observations where the model predicted the person is healthy (0), and they are actually healthy (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**_False Positives (FP)_**: The number of observations where the model predicted the person has the disease (1), but they are actually healthy (0). \n",
    "\n",
    "**_False Negatives (FN)_**: The number of observations where the model predicted the person is healthy (0), but they actually have the disease (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example confusion matrix:\n",

    "<img src='https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/images/rf-conf-matrix.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, one axis of the confusion matrix represents the ground-truth value of the items the model made predictions on, while the other axis represents the labels predicted by the classifier. To read a confusion matrix, look at the intersection of each row and column to tell what each cell represents. For instance, in the example above, the bottom right square represents _True Positives_, because it is the intersection of \"True Label: 1\" row and the \"Predicted Label: 1\" column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take another look at the diagram above and see if you can figure out which cells represent TN, FP, and FN. "

    "## Confusion matrices for multi-categorical classification\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've kept it simple by only focusing on confusion matrices for binary classification problems. However, it's common to see classification tasks that are **_multi-categorical_** in nature. We can keep track of these by just expanding the number of rows and columns in our confusion matrix!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/images/cm2.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is from the Reuters Newsgroups dataset. As we can see in the example above, we use an equivalent number of rows and columns, with each row and column sharing the same index referring to the same class. In this, the true labels are represented by the rows, while the predicted classes are represented by the columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the diagonal starting in the top-left and moving down to the right. This diagonal represents our **_True Positives_** since the indexes are the same for both row and column. For instance, we can see at location \\[19, 19\\] that 281 political articles about guns were correctly classified as political articles about guns. Since our model is multi-categorical, we may also be interested in exactly **_how_** a model was incorrect with certain predictions. For instance, by looking at \\[4, 19\\], you can conclude that 33 articles that were of category _talk.politics.misc_ were incorrectly classified as _talk.politics.guns_.  Note that when viewed through the lens of the *talk.politics.misc*, these are **_False Negatives_** -- our model said they weren't about this topic, and they were. However, they are also **_False Positives_** for *talk.politics.guns*, since our model said they were about this, and they weren't!\n",

    "### Use `sklearn` to create confusion matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Since **_confusion matrices_** are a vital part of evaluating supervised learning classification problems, it's only natural that `sklearn` has a quick and easy way to create them. You'll find the `confusion_matrix()` function inside the `sklearn.metrics` module. This function expects two arguments -- the labels, and the predictions, in that order. "
